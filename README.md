# Crime_Data 
This is a demo of an R analysis project. A hypothtical politician on the political campaign trail is running on the promise
of putting more police on the streets to lower crime. We have been hired by a rival politician to examine the
validity of that strategy. Our goal in this lab is determine how hiring more police would impact crime rate.
Enlarging the police force is an action politicians can do relatively quickly, making it an attractive campaign
platform and important action to evaluate properly. Itâ€™s anticipated that this report can help inform future
policy initiatives and election campaign platforms with regards to crime.
Our analysis concludes with an identification of counties that are considered over-policed or under-policed
based on conditions of population density, percent of young males in the community, relative wealth of the
community, and crime rate.
